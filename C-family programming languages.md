# C-family programming languages

Dennis Ritchie invented the C programming language. Broadly speaking, C-family languages are those that use C-like block syntax (including curly braces to begin and end the block). The family spreads out over several programming paradigms, including procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and generic programming, as well as having both native code and virtual machine runtime environments.
